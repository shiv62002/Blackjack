This project simulates a game of Blackjack by using a simple GUI user interface. The project is linked to a GUI to display a deck of cards on a users screen. The contents of the files in this project perfrom complex operations by utilizing a random number generator. The random number generator serves the purpose of outputting randomized values to create and shuffle a deck of cards using Eclipse. These randomized values are generated and passed into two seperate ENUMs. The two ENUMs are implemented to represent different suits and values in a deck of cards respectively. These ENUMs are also utilized to assign card suits and values to each individual card. Each inidvidual cards is read into the system using a reader for each players hand. By using the values pulled from the reader, calculations to compare the hands of a player and dealer help determine the outcome of each individual game. This process is repeated upon the user's command to start another game.

This project shows my ability to utilize a number of vital Java tools. For example, the project showcases my ability to utilize and implement a random number generator, scanners, ENUMs, and a GUI. The project also highlights my ability to ensure efiiciency in my code using JUnit testing. Overall, the project shows my proficeincy in utilizing a number of complex Java applications.
