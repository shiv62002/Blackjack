      This project simulates a game of Blackjack by using a simple GUI user interface. The project is linked to a GUI to display a deck of cards on a users screen. The contents of the files in this project perform complex operations by utilizing a random number generator. The random number generator outputs randomized values to create and shuffle a deck of cards using Eclipse. These randomized values are generated and passed into two separate ENUMs. The two ENUMs represent different suits and values in a deck of cards respectively. These ENUMs are also utilized to assign card suits and values to each individual card. Each individual card is read into the system using a reader for each player's hand. Using the values pulled from the reader, calculations to compare the hands of a player and dealer help determine the outcome of each individual game. This process is repeated upon the user's command to start another game.
      
      This project shows my ability to utilize a number of vital Java tools. For example, the project showcases my ability to operate and implement a random number generator, scanners, ENUMs, and a GUI. The project also highlights my ability to ensure efficiency in my code using JUnit testing. Overall, the project shows my proficiency in utilizing several complex Java applications.
